### How to download?

Add Keyboard Dismisser as a dependency in your app level ```build.gradle``` file.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.gabrielsamojlo.keyboarddismisser:keyboard-dismisser:1.3.1'
}

```

You can now use Keyboard Dismisser!

### How to use?

Keyboard Dismisser works on whole Activity of your application or on specific Fragment.
To use it with Activity, you just need to inform Keyboard Dismisser that you want to use it in your ```onCreate``` method :

```java
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        KeyboardDismisser.useWith(this);
    }
```

For fragments, you should place it in ```onViewCreated``` :

```java
    public void onViewCreated(View view, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState);

        KeyboardDismisser.useWith(this);
    }
```
